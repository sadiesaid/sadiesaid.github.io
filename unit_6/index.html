			<h3>Logo Creation</h3>
			<p>Make a lasting impression.</p>
			<p>It’s as simple as that. We’ll ask questions, get you to tell stories, join you in board meetings or on your morning run. Whatever it takes to get to know what makes you and your business tick. We’ll take care of research, analysis, design, drafting, and refinement so we can present you with the best options.</p>

			<h3>Brand Look and Feel, Style Guides</h3>
			<p>Every time you get dressed, remember that if you die, that’s going to be your ghost outfit forever.</p> 
			<p>We’ll ensure all brand touch points are communicating a consistent message.</p>
			<p>First, we’ll ascertain what this message is, then we’ll present different methods for clearly communicating it. Once everything is finalised, you’ll have your own styleguide to refer back to whenever you need. Handy.</p>

			<h3>Posters, Flyers, Invitations and Banners</h3>
			<p>Microsoft Word can only do so much.</p>
			<p>We can design posters and banners of any size, for anything. We are only limited by the information you tell us, so the more we know, the better.</p> 
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Business Cards</h3>
			<p>As humans, we’re limited when it comes to memory, so make it easy for people to remember you and your business.</p>
			<p>A business card isn’t required to be a small, landscape, one sided piece of cardboard… Really, there isn’t a rule. Not only are printing options close to endless, so arethe ways in which you can design and format a business card.</p>
		<div>	
			<h3>Marketing Material</h3>
			<p>It’s very likely you already have a list of the marketing materials you require, so we won’t have you read through another one in order to demonstrate what we can create.</p> 
			<p>We can assist at any stage of the design process, whether you need to create soft copies, print ready artwork, templates or just branded icons to add to what you already have.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Websites and Online Stores</h3>
			<p>If you’re not online, you’re nowhere – Anonymous.</p>
			<p>Creating a presence online is daunting, creating a store that exists only online...Well, that sounds terrifying. We've the experience to make these things less scary, so you can focus on the more exciting things</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Social Media</h3>
			<p>Brand consistency is paramount across all mediums, however it’s especially important on social media. The social media landscape constantly changes and let’s face it, there is a lot going on, all the time.</p>
			<p>We prefer to help out right from the beginning, we like to plan with you then execute, measure results and re-execute however if you already have a plan, we can jump in with some extra hands at any time. We can assist in creating social media post templates too, so you can go away and create posts yourself.</p>
