			<h3>Logo Creation</h3>
			<p>Make a lasting impression.</p>
			<p>It’s as simple as that. We’ll ask questions, get you to tell stories, join you in board meetings or on your morning run. Whatever it takes to get to know what makes you and your business tick. We’ll take care of research, analysis, design, drafting, and refinement so we can present you with the best options.</p>

			<h3>Brand Look and Feel, Style Guides</h3>
			<p>Every time you get dressed, remember that if you die, that’s going to be your ghost outfit forever.</p> 
			<p>We’ll ensure all brand touch points are communicating a consistent message.</p>
			<p>First, we’ll ascertain what this message is, then we’ll present different methods for clearly communicating it. Once everything is finalised, you’ll have your own styleguide to refer back to whenever you need. Handy.</p>

			<h3>Posters, Flyers, Invitations and Banners</h3>
			<p>Microsoft Word can only do so much.</p>
			<p>We can design posters and banners of any size, for anything. We are only limited by the information you tell us, so the more we know, the better.</p>
